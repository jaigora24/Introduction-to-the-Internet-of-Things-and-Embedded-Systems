1.   Identify and analyze a device that is an IoT device now, but in the past was a non-IoT device .Describe and list the features of the device.
     Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.

>>>      Old traditional watch :
                    Needs Battery
         Smart IoT watch :
                    Contains different sensors
                    Chargeable
                    Calculates many things in our body such as Blood Pressure, Heart rates etc.
                    


2.     Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.

>>>    Old traditional watch :
                    Shows only time
          Smart IoT watch :
                    Shows time
                    Calculates Heart rates, Blood Pressure etc.
                    Connects to the smart phones
                    

3.     For your chosen IoT device, list any improvements or any diminishments if they exist, over the non- IOT device. Describe any limitations
       that are present in the new IoT version of the device.

>>>    Improvements :
                    Facilitates life
                    Make calls
           Diminishments :
                    No security
           Limitations :
                    Screen size is small
                    

4.      Describe any privacy issues with the IoT device that never existed in the original version of the device. Compare the price of the original
        device to the price of the new IoT version of the device. When performing a price comparison, attempt to normalize for the changing value
        of currency over time by using an online inflation calculator.

>>>       Issues :
                    They can detect your locations
          Comparisons:
                    Old traditional watch costs nearly about $500
                    Smart IoT watch costs nearly about $1000.
