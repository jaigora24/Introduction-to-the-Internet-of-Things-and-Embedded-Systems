1.     Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. There are several microcontroller manufacturers
       that you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information.
       (Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you found this information.)  
       Clock frequency
       Bitwidth of the datapath
       Size of Flash memory
       Number of pins
       Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? If so, how many bits of precision does it have?
       

>>>        ATmega32 - RenesasRX
                Clock Frequency : 1 MIPS - 240 MHz
                Bitwidth of the datapath : 8 bit - 32 bit
                Size of Flash memory : 32 KB - 512 KB
                Number of pins : 44 - 64
                Analog to Digital converter : 10 bit ADC - 12 bit ADC

2.     Research the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. Indicate if there are operating systems which can be used on each platform. If there
       are, list those operating systems.State whether the operating systems are open source or not.
       

>>>      1.        Arduino : There is no Operating system which can be used on this platform.
                   Raspberry Pi  : There are many Operating system which can be used on this platform suchas Raspbian, OSMS (OpenSourceMediaCentre),
                                   RISC OS, Windows IoT Core, Lakka etc.

         2.        Arduino : No Operating system
                   Raspberry Pi : Yes, Operating system are open source.
